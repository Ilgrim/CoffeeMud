<p>If you've ever popped open the resources/chat.dat file

tried to read the instructions, you'll be familiar with this:</p>

<p>Helpful and clear, eh? Here's a&nbsp;breakdown of the basics:</p>
<p>The chat.dat file is basically a giant text file that is
used
for pattern-matching, with a couple of extra features. What this means
is that you enter 'trigger' text and when the MOB hears someone say it,
they'll respond with whatever you set for them to say. An example is
warranted:</p>
<p>Bo decides he wants MOBs to praise CoffeeMud in a couple
ways
when it's mentioned. He opens up his chat.dat file. He would enter this:</p>
<pre>(coffeemud)<br />9I've heard of CoffeeMud. Isn't that that slick Java MUD codebase?<br />6CoffeeMud? What the heck is that?<br />2:smiles warmly.<br /><br />(fish)<br />9Fish with Chips is the Best!<br />6I don't care for fish, $t.<br /></pre>
<p>There's a few different things to understand there:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace;">(coffeemud)</span>-
This is the matching trigger text. Anyone saying
"Hey
- how do you feel about CoffeeMud?", "whats coffeemud", or anything
else with (case insensitive) 'coffeemud' in it will trigger the
following response lines. <span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><span style="font-family: monospace;">(fish)</span> is the matching trigger text for another set of responses that only applies to fish. &nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace;">9I've
heard of... 2:smiles warmly</span>.- These are the
possible
responses. This is where things get a little trickier. The system is
looking for what's in the first two columns:</p>
<p>The first column <b>must</b> be a
number (the weight),
from 1-9. It's not exactly a percentage type thing, but just understand
that 9 means it's really likely and 1 means highly unlikely. You can
have as many possible responses as you'd like at whatever weight you'd
like.</p>
<p>The second column <b>optionally</b> can
be either&nbsp;: "&nbsp; ` or&nbsp;!. If it'none of these, the MOB will
simply say the line. <br /></p><ul><li>If it's&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span>
then the MOB will emote the line.</li><li>If it's <span style="font-weight: bold;">"</span> then the MOB will simply say the line.</li><li>If
it's <span style="font-weight: bold;">`</span>
then the&nbsp;line will be submitted to the AI/LLM you have installed,
or be ignored if not. &nbsp;The MOB will then say whatever the LLM
responds with. &nbsp; Use the $w variable to include the original
triggering phrase.. </li><li>If it's <span style="font-weight: bold;">!</span>, the MOB will treat the
line as a normal mud command.<br /><br />The other thing to note here is that you don't need a space
after either the 1st or 2nd columns.<br /></li></ul></li><li>Trigger matches like <span style="font-family: monospace;">(coffeemud)</span> or <span style="font-family: monospace;">(fish)</span> can be prefixed with zero or more certain special characters that inform MudChat about how and when they apply. &nbsp;<br /><ul><li>If you prefix the trigger with an asterisk, like <span style="font-family: monospace;">*(fish)</span>, then the trigger will only apply if the MOB is in combat.</li><li>If you prefix the trigger with a capital-L, like <span style="font-family: monospace;">L(fish)</span>, then the trigger will only apply if an AI/LLM integration is installed (see Installation Guide)</li><li>If you prefix the trigger with a period, like <span style="font-family: monospace;">.(fish)</span>, then the trigger will only apply if an AI/LLM integration is NOT installed.</li></ul></li><li><p>So!
&nbsp;The MOB,
upon
hearing 'coffeemud', will say 'I've heard of CoffeeMud. Isn't that that
slick Java MUD codebase?', or may say 'CoffeeMud? What the heck is
that?',
or (least likely, it will emote 'smiles warmly'). &nbsp;&nbsp;If
someone says "Hey, do you like CoffeeMud or Fish?", it will match both <span style="font-family: monospace;">(coffeemud)</span> and <span style="font-family: monospace;">(fish)</span>, expanding the number of possible responses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, with those basics of triggers and responses clear, you can do
some
fancier things pattern matching that just one word patterns like <span style="font-family: monospace;">(coffeemud)</span>. There are
and, or, and and-not characters you can use in the pattern matching.</p>
<ul>
<li>&amp; - This is the obvious and character. So
(java&amp;mud) would trigger on anyone saying both 'java' and 'mud'
in
the same sentence.</li>
<li>| - This is the or character. So (hello|hi) would
trigger
on anyone saying either 'hello' or 'hi'</li>
<li>~ - This is the and-not character. So,
"c1"&gt;(kill~yourself) would trigger on anyone saying 'kill' but
would
if anyone said 'kill him yourself' etc..</li>
<li>/ - This is the zapper mask character, so
(coffeemud&amp;/-GENDER +FEMALE/) would trigger only if a female
says
coffeemud. &nbsp;See help on ZAPPERMASK for more information.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use all of the
&lt;S-HIS-HER&gt; type codes
that CoffeeMud uses (See Programming Guide) in your trigger/match
strings in order to capture normal non-speaking messages.&nbsp;</p><p>In the responses, several variables are available for inserting into the response strings in order to enhance them, such as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">$t</span> in&nbsp;<span style="font-family: monospace;">6I don't care for fish, $t.</span> &nbsp;from the examples above.</p><ul><li>$r - rest of triggering message after the match.</li><li>$w - the entire message matched.</li><li>$n &nbsp;- the character npc/chatters name</li><li>$t - the targets name (the person who being replied to)</li><li>$$ - equal to $, making it the surest way to get a displayed $ character.</li><li>${...} Returns a generic stat value for the NPC. See LIST STATS from the mud for a complete list.</li><ul><li>Examples: ${GENDERNAME} for the NPC.</li></ul><li>$&lt;...&gt; Returns a generic stat value for the target. See LIST STATS.</li><ul><li>Example: ${ALIGNMENTDESC} for the targets alignment word.</li></ul><ul><li>STATS also include: THEMEDESC, ROOMDESC, and PERSONALITY</li></ul><li>$%...% Causes the part of the sentence to be evaluated by the MOBPROG Scriptable system as a function.</li><ul><li>Example $%INAREA($n)% to show the area name of the NPC.</li></ul><li>~ Separates one or more responses on a line. May be followed by one of operators: ", :, or !.</li><ul><li>Example <span style="font-family: monospace;">6I don't care for fish, $t.~"They are too slimey.~:pukes.</span></li></ul></ul>
<h3><a name="groups">ChatGroups</a></h3>
<p>There's some very unhelpful sentences in there about
databases. This is a better explanation.</p>
<p>There are several ChatGroups defined in the distribution
copy
of chat.dat. Some are pretty clear. Here's one (shortened a bit):</p>
<pre>############################################################<br />&gt;healer cleric doctor<br /><br />(hi|hello)<br />9hello $t, how may I help you?<br />2I could heal you.<br /><br />(help &amp; (healer|cleric|doctor) | hurt | pain | sick)<br />7:prays for you<br />2Please undress, so I can see your injuries.<br />5You look great.<br /><br />(job|career)<br />7I cure the pitiful<br />1I am a healer<br /><br />@default<br /></pre>
<p>You'll find this pretty much at the end of the file.
What this
means, is the ChatGroup is named "healer", "cleric", and "doctor" (the
line of #'s is just remark characters, marking it up a bit for
readability - it's the '&gt;' that marks a ChatGroup). So, any MOB
set
to the ChatGroups 'healer', 'cleric', or 'doctor' will respond with
these patterns. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another trick you can use to narrow matches on a
ChatGroup
with the &gt; command is to include a CoffeeMud Zapper Mask. In
that
case the zapper masks would be included in your set of matching words
by surrounding it with '/' characters like so:&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<pre>&gt;healer cleric doctor /-GENDER +female/<br /></pre>
<p>Adding the mask at the end will give the additional
requirement that the healer be a female before the chat group is
matched. &nbsp;Check the Archon help files on ZAPPERMASK for more
information on the kinds of values you can put in there.<br />
</p>
<p>At the bottom of our original ChatGroup is a linking
character, @, pointing to default. That means that this group will
respond with the pattern you see here first, and if nothing matches,
will then go on to check in the default for matches.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The default ChatGroup is simply any patterns entered
BEFORE
any other ChatGroups are defined, hence why all the ChatGroups are, and
should be, towards the bottom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The linking character preceded by a $, as in '$@mygroup' can be
appended to the end of a response string to cause the ChatGroup to
either switch to another (in this case 'mygroup'), or append another if
'$@+mygroup' with the plus sign is used. &nbsp;This absolutely must
occur at the end of the response string though. &nbsp; If you don't
recall what a response is, see the previous section.</p><p>There are some caveats to using @. You can only link to
groups
that were defined before the link. So, if you wanted a ChatGroup called
'clericforhire' that included some of its own patterns, plus the
'cleric' patterns, you would need to create &gt;clericforhire in
the
file AFTER &gt;healer cleric doctor, and put @cleric at the bottom
of
&gt;clericforhire. (More tricks with ChatGroups are in the Power
Tricks
section).</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="bold">Important Note: The files are
loaded as part of
the startup process - changes made to chat.dat while the MUD is running
are not applied until the next startup, or until the UNLOAD command is
used against the chat RESOURCES (LIST RESOURCES command)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="apply" id="apply">Applying
MUDChat Behaviors</a></h2>
<p>Applying the MUDChat Behavior to MOBs is super easy, and
setting the MOB to use a particular ChatGroup is straight-forward as
well.</p>
<h3><a name="grinder">Methods</a></h3>
<p>Edit/Create a MOB as usual. In the Behavior list, put
MUDChat. &nbsp; The empty box next to it is the MudChat parameters.<br /><br />Edit/Create a MOB as usual. In the Behavior list, add
MUDChat.
It will ask you for any parameters.</p><p>If any case you leave the options box empty, the MOB will only use patterns in
the @default ChatGroup. If you want to specify which ChatGroup, type
its name in the options box. So, if you were setting up a cleric, you
would put 'cleric' in the options text.</p>
<h3><a name="mob">MudChat Parameters</a></h3>
<p>If you specifiy no parameters, the
MOB will only use patterns in the @default ChatGroup, or attempt to find a chat group that shares its name or race.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to
specify which ChatGroup from chat.dat to use, type its name in as the parameter.</p><p>If you want to specify a different .dat file to use AND which chat group in that new file to select, use an equal sign, like:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: monospace;">mychat.dat=mychatgroup</span></p><p>The above will load the file <span style="font-weight: bold;">/resources/mychat.dat</span>
file, which uses the same rules as the chat.dat above. &nbsp;In the
example, "mychatgroup" would be the name of a chat group in that file
that the npc will use.</p><p>If you want to include any additions or
variable overrides to an existing .dat file, you would put those after
a plus sign +, after an equal sign, and semicolon ; delimited&nbsp; for
example:</p><p><span style="font-family: monospace;">chat.dat=mygroup+(here there);9neither </span><span style="font-family: monospace;">${hnt}</span><span style="font-family: monospace;">;5well, where?;1nowhere;${hnt=Here nor There!}</span></p><p>The above would select the chat group "mygroup" from the default chat.dat file, but add the following to it:<br /></p><p><span style="font-family: monospace;">(here there)<br />9neither</span><span style="font-family: monospace;"> </span><span style="font-family: monospace;">${hnt}</span><br /><span style="font-family: monospace;">5well, where?<br />1nowhere<br /><br /></span><span style="font-family: monospace;">${hnt=Here nor There!}</span></p><p>The
above defines a new pattern to match (here there), with a few
responses, and then defines the variable "hnt" to be "Here nor There!",
which can be used like ${hnt} in response strings.</p><p>If you want to
keep the default chat.dat file AND the default chat group, but still
add new stuff, you can still do that by leaving the first two fields
blank:<br /></p><p><span style="font-family: monospace;">=+(here there);9neither </span><span style="font-family: monospace;">${hnt}</span><span style="font-family: monospace;">;5well, where?;1nowhere;${hnt=Here nor There!}</span></p><h3><a name="llm">LLM</a></h3>
<p>If you have configured CoffeeMud to use an AI/LLM system (see <a href="InstallationGuide.html">Installation Guide</a>),
then you can use MudChat to immediately take advantage of it, by
overriding or supplementing its default behaviors with LLM activities.</p><p>To
get started, there are two internal MudChat variables that LLM will set
need for best results. &nbsp; Variables are defined either in a
chat.dat, or in the parameters, by using the ${VAR=VAL} and ${VAR+VAL}
syntax. &nbsp;'VAR' would be the name of the variable, and VAL would be
the value to set to it. &nbsp;VAR+VAL is the syntax for appending to a
previously defined variable.</p><p>The variable relevant to AI/LLM is LLMPROMPT and LLMMEM. &nbsp;</p><p>LLMMEM is the number of messages that the session will remember, not
including the first one, which is always remembered no matter what. &nbsp; Without setting this variable, the default amount of memory is about 10 messages. </p><p>LLMPROMPT
is the message that is sent to the LLM preceding the its first input
when the session is created. &nbsp;Without setting this variable, the
default prompt would be empty. &nbsp;Of these, the LLMPROMPT is most
important, as it is normally used to establish the rules for its
personality. &nbsp;The default chat.dat file uses the following
LLMPROMPT definition: &nbsp;"Pretend to be a ${GENDERNAME} ${RACE}
whose name is ${NAME}, and who lives in a ${THEMEDESC} area called
$%INAREA($n)%. You are currently at ${ROOMDESC}, are usually seen by
others as "${DISPLAY}. ${DESCRIPTION}".&nbsp;Your moral alignment is
${ALIGNMENTDESC}, and your personality traits are ${PERSONALITY}.
Please only deliver dialog responses, never emote, and keep responses
under 3 sentences. Begin now: ". &nbsp;You'll notice how many variables
are referenced in building this string for the AI to consume, but also
note the last sentence, that strives to keep the AI brief and well
formatted as dialog.</p><p>When writing your matching trigger patterns, you can write them in 3 different ways to be LLM aware:</p><pre>L(hi|hello)<br />9hello $t, I am capable of LLM speech!<br /></pre><p>The
first is to prefix it with a capital L, which denotes a trigger pattern
that will ONLY be used if CoffeeMud has an LLM integrated and active.
&nbsp;It otherwise works normally.</p><pre>.(hi|hello)<br />9hello $t, I am capable of LLM speech!<br /></pre><p>The second&nbsp;is to prefix it with a period, which denotes a trigger pattern
that will ONLY be used if CoffeeMud does not have any active LLM integration, but is 'stock'.</p><pre>(hi|hello)<br />9hello $t, I am capable of LLM speech!<br /></pre><p>The
last is to not put a prefix at all, but use the normal matching
character (, [, etc. &nbsp;These trigger patterns will be evaluated
regardless of LLM integration.</p><p>The next special LLM feature is around the LLM response, which is prefixed with a single quote character ':</p><p><span style="font-family: monospace;">(here there)<br />9"Hello. &nbsp;This is a normal response.</span><span style="font-family: monospace;"></span><br /><span style="font-family: monospace;">5'Hello LLM, please respond to the prompt '$w'.<br /></span></p><p>The
single quote character does not work like the double quote. &nbsp;
Instead of the message after the quote being spoken by the NPC, it is
instead sent to the LLM, and the NPC will then say whatever the LLM
responds with.</p>
<h2><a name="power" id="power">Some
MUDChat Power Tricks</a></h2><p>Suppose you have a city called Yares. In this city are various
mobs -
guards, shopkeepers, commoners, bankers, etc.. You can setup groups in the
chat.dat called guard, shopkeeper, banker, commoner, etc, and give them
each appropriate patterns and responses for their type.</p>
<p>Then, you setup two more .DAT files, Yares and World.
In
Yares, you can put a bunch of patterns in relevant to getting around in the
city (like 'weapons'<br />
or 'inn' - both trigger directions to relevant shops). In World, you can put
more global geography (IE, 'avalon' gets 'avalon is west of yares').</p>
<p>Now, back in Chat.dat, you created more groups, called
YaresGuard, YaresShopkeeper, etc... The only lines that went into each
were:</p>
<pre> %Yares.dat<br /> %World.dat<br /> @guard (or @banker or @default or whatever)<br /></pre>
<p>%filename includes the filename's contents in-line (as
if it
were typed in)</p>
<p>This sets up each type to know a little about their
city,
something about the world, and gave them some text for their profession.</p>
<p>So, in our system, if a new player is walking around
Yares,
they can ask a cityguard where Market Street is or where they can find
a healer and get useful answers (well, not if you want to code
misinformation for a chuckle)</p>
